orthopedic surgery,"Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system. Orthopedic deals with the correction of deformities or functional impairments of the skeletal system. Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders.Orthopedic deals with the correction of deformities or functional impairments of the skeletal system. Orthopedic surgeons receive additional training beyond what general surgeons receive, with a focus on diagnosing and treating injuries and diseases of the bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves. This includes procedures like joint replacements (eg. hip replacement and knee replacemt), fracture repair and amputations. Orthopedic surgeons often work closely with prosthetics to fit and manage prosthetic limbs after an amputation."
general surgery,"General surgeons are able to perform amputations, but there is a surgical specialty that focuses more specifically on amputations and other procedures related to the musculoskeletal system. That speciality is orthopedic surgery. General surgeons may perform amputations in some cases, especially for lower extremity amputations."
ENT,"Also known as Otorhinolaryngology is a surgical subspecialty within medicine that deals with the surgical and medical management of conditions of the head and neck. Doctors who specialize in this area are called otorhinolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons, or ENT surgeons or physicians. Ear surgery may involve procedures to address hearing loss, infections, or other ear disorders. Nose surgery, or rhinoplasty, can correct deformities or improve nasal function and appearance. Throat surgery can address issues like tonsillitis, sleep apnea, or throat cancer. Sinus surgery treats chronic sinus infections or structural issues in the nasal passages."
obstetrics,"Obstetrics and Gynaecology is the medical specialty that encompasses the two subspecialties of obstetric (covering pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period) and gynecology (covering the health of the female reproductive system: vagina, uterus, ovaries, and breasts). The specialization is an important part of care for women's health."

gallbladder removal,"Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy is a common treatment of symptomatic gallstones, inflammation and other gallbladder conditions."
pediatric surgery,"Pediatric surgery is the only surgical specialty that is defined by the patient's age rather than by a specific condition and deals with the diseases, trauma and malformations from the fetal period to teenage years. Pediatric urology deals with urinary tract and reproductive system issues in children. Pediatric hernia surgery treats hernias in children, commonly inguinal hernias. Pediatric appendectomy is the removal of the appendix in children, typically due to appendicitis."
laparoscopy,Laparoscopy is an operation performed in the abdomen or pelvis using small incisions with the aid of a camera. The laparoscope aids diagnosis or therapeutic interventions with a few small cuts in the abdomen. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive procedure to remove the gallbladder. Laparoscopic hysterectomy involves removing the uterus through small incisions with the aid of a camera. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a weight loss surgery that involves removing a portion of the stomach.
hysteroscopic sterilization,Hysteroscopic sterilization is a method of permanent birth control that prevents a woman's eggs from traveling through the fallopian tubes to reach sperm. The procedure requires no general anesthesia or incisions.
tonsillectomy,"A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils,  often to treat chronic infections or obstructive sleep apnea. Tonsils are lumps of tissue on both sides of the back of the throat that help the immune system protect the body from infections. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgeries kids and teens get. Surgeons use many methods to perform tonsillectomies, including: Electrocautery: This method uses heat to remove the tonsils and stop any bleeding. Cold knife (steel) dissection: A surgeon uses a scalpel (traditional surgical knife) to remove your tonsils."
appendectomy,"An appendectomy is the surgical removal of the appendix, which is located in the right lower side of the abdomen, usually due to appendicitis. Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix that often necessitates surgical removal of the appendix.
